## Features
- Input form for car name and lap time
- Dynamic table displaying all laps
- Best and average lap time stats
- Input validation (non-empty name, positive time)
- Form clears after submission
- Optional: Canvas bar chart for lap times

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/motorsport-lap-timer-js.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser

## Learned Topics
- JavaScript: Variables (`let`, `const`), arrays, `for` loops, functions, DOM manipulation (`innerHTML`, `innerText`), events (`addEventListener`), validation (`isNaN`)
- HTML/CSS: Forms, tables, basic styling
- Debugging: Chrome DevTools, `console.log`, breakpoints
- Git: Commits, pushes, README creation
- Optional: Canvas API for charts

## Future Plans
- v2: Add local storage and object-oriented programming
- v3: Integrate OpenTelemetry for performance tracking
